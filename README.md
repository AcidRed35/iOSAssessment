## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Example App: NYTimes
Quick to load content.
Simple and intuitive navigation.


Example App: Tweek
Non cluttered layout.
Easy to manage tasks on the fly.


Example App: Project Indigo
Camera app that makes unprocessed images look go.
Ability to quickly utilize more professional toggles if needed.

I want a simplified home dashboard app. User can load details for certain processes to be monitored and quickly reference in a single page. To include, but not limited to, media server status, smart home status, power outage details, battery level and runtime of network devices, time/date of most recent access. Click through to view additional details or take action. Ideally, easy to add and maintain different nodes.
